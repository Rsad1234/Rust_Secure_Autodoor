# Rust Backup Generator
*This is designed for 8 lootrooms, the switches will be stored as 1 in each lootroom and will be turned off when logging off. When all switches are turned on then the autodoor mechanic will work, however if any of the eight are switched off then the autodoor mechanic will not work, this is to prevent raiders from switching on the main switch and gaining access to the base after claiming the TC.*
